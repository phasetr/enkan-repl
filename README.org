** Vision: Reviving REPL Culture for the AI Era
This package differs technically from traditional REPLs (Read-Eval-Print Loop).
While conventional REPLs execute code and return results,
=claudemacs-repl= sends text to Claude AI and receives generated responses.

However, we view this difference not as a constraint,
but as a new possibility.
Our dream is to revive the interactive development culture that LISP, Elisp,
and Emacs have nurtured for decades,
in a form befitting the AI era.

Send your thoughts with =send-region=,
receive Claude's response,
and deepen your thinking further.
This cycle is the development experience that the new era's REPL envisions.
Here lies a completely new programming horizon woven by Emacs and AI.

** Motivation
The development motivation stems from the current usability issues with Claude Code and Gemini CLI,
particularly the difficulty of text input and the non-persistent nature of personal input history.
While file-based input is somewhat possible,
it's extremely cumbersome to use.

In terminals,
input and copy-paste operations are difficult,
making revisions troublesome.
Furthermore, when something comes to mind during AI work,
you need to leave the terminal to take notes,
creating an extremely unpleasant development experience.

I constantly wished for the ability to easily take notes in text files
and send only the necessary parts as commands to AI,
keeping inspired thoughts noted for immediate use after AI work is complete.
For text work, I naturally turned to Emacs.
After trying several packages that didn't quite fit,
I decided to build my own on top of [[https://github.com/cpoile/claudemacs][claudemacs]].

** Features

*** Text Sending Capabilities
- =claudemacs-repl-send-region= - Send selected text to Claude
- =claudemacs-repl-send-buffer= - Send entire buffer content
- =claudemacs-repl-send-rest-of-buffer= - Send from cursor position to end
- =claudemacs-repl-send-line= - Send current line
- =claudemacs-repl-send-enter= - Send enter key for prompts
- =claudemacs-repl-send-1/2/3= - Send numbered choices for AI prompts
- *File Path Support*: Send file paths for Claude to read directly (e.g., =~/project/config.json=)
- *Planned*: Esc key sending command under development

*** Project Management
These features rely on the underlying claudemacs functionality,
and their constraints depend on that implementation.

- *Persistent Input Files*: Org-mode files with filename-encoded directory mapping
  (based on claudemacs buffer name mode detection specification as of Aug 2025)
- *Template System*: Customizable templates with default.org included
- *Directory-based Targeting*: Automatically match files to appropriate claudemacs sessions
- *Multi-project Support*: Handle multiple Claude sessions in different directories simultaneously

*** Session Management
- =claudemacs-repl-start-claudemacs= - Launch Claude session in appropriate directory
  (only wraps =claudemacs-transient-menu=)
- =claudemacs-repl-setup-window-layout= - Set up convenient window arrangement
  (for the author: the left side is the input file,
  and the right side is the claudemacs buffer)
- =claudemacs-repl-status= - Comprehensive diagnostic information

*** Utility Functions
- =claudemacs-repl-output-template= - Export input file template for customization
- =claudemacs-repl-toggle-debug-mode= - Debug mode for troubleshooting

** Design Philosophy

*** Org-mode Only Choice
This package exclusively uses Org-mode for input files,
leveraging Emacs's native compatibility and structured document capabilities.
Rather than supporting multiple formats like Markdown,
we focus on what works best within the Emacs ecosystem.

*** No Default Keybindings
We intentionally provide no default keybindings for several reasons:
- Org-mode users often have heavily customized configurations
- Serious Emacs users (especially those who don't "cheat" with VSCode)
  may have unpredictable customization patterns
- Avoiding conflicts with existing user workflows

*** `M-x` Driven Workflow
The author's personal approach assumes complete focus during AI development sessions.
All functions are accessed via =M-x= with fuzzy matching,
which works efficiently when you're concentrated on AI interaction.
During Claude development work,
the frequently used functions (=send-region=, =send-rest-of-buffer=)
naturally appear at the top of completion lists.

** Installation

*** Prerequisites
- Emacs 28.1 or later
- [[https://github.com/cpoile/claudemacs][claudemacs]] package installed and configured
- [[https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code][Claude Code CLI]] properly set up

*Note*: This package has been developed and tested exclusively on macOS with GNU Emacs 30.1.
While it should work on other platforms and Emacs versions (28.1+),
compatibility with other environments has not been verified.

*** Using straight.el (Recommended)
#+begin_src elisp
(straight-use-package
  '(claudemacs-repl :host github :repo "phasetr/claudemacs-repl"))
#+end_src

*** Manual Installation
1. Download =claudemacs-repl.el=
2. Add to your Emacs configuration:

#+begin_src elisp
;; Add to load path
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/claudemacs-repl")

;; Load the package
(require 'claudemacs-repl)
#+end_src

** Quick Start

*** For New Projects (Recommended)

1. *Create a dedicated project directory*:
   #+begin_src bash
   mkdir my-claude-project
   cd my-claude-project
   #+end_src

2. *Initialize Git repository*:
   #+begin_src bash
   git init
   #+end_src
   /This ensures Claude sessions are isolated and changes are tracked safely./

3. *Open project file*: =M-x claudemacs-repl-open-project-input-file=
4. *Start Claude session*: =M-x claudemacs-repl-start-claudemacs=
5. *Write your thoughts* in the org-mode file
6. *Send specific parts* using =M-x claudemacs-repl-send-region= or =M-x claudemacs-repl-send-rest-of-buffer=

*** For Existing Projects

*Important*: claudemacs automatically detects Git repositories or something and may start sessions in parent directories: see [[https://github.com/cpoile/claudemacs?tab=readme-ov-file#workspace-and-project-aware-sessions][the usage section for claudemacs]].

To ensure predictable behavior:
- Work within properly initialized Git repositories (=git init=)
- Or use dedicated project directories as shown above

The generated project file includes template functions and usage instructions.

** Core Functions

*** File Management
- =claudemacs-repl-open-project-input-file= - Create/open persistent input file for current directory

*** Text Sending
- =claudemacs-repl-send-region= - Send selected text (most commonly used, the author think)
- =claudemacs-repl-send-rest-of-buffer= - Send from cursor to end (second most used)
- =claudemacs-repl-send-buffer= - Send entire buffer
- =claudemacs-repl-send-line= - Send current line only

*** Session Control
- =claudemacs-repl-send-enter= - Send enter key
- =claudemacs-repl-send-1/2/3= - Send numbered choices for AI prompts

*** Utilities
- =claudemacs-repl-start-claudemacs= - Start Claude session in appropriate directory
- =claudemacs-repl-setup-window-layout= - Arrange windows for (the author's) optimal workflow
- =claudemacs-repl-status= - Display connection status and diagnostics

** Configuration

*** Template Customization
#+begin_src elisp
;; Use default template
(setq claudemacs-repl-template-file nil)

;; Use custom template file
(setq claudemacs-repl-template-file "~/my-claude-template.org")

;; Use project-specific template
(setq claudemacs-repl-template-file (expand-file-name "claude-template.org" user-emacs-directory))
#+end_src

To create a custom template,
use =M-x claudemacs-repl-output-template= to export the default template to a buffer for editing.

** Troubleshooting
If you encounter "‚ùå Cannot send - no matching claudemacs buffer found for this directory":

1. Ensure claudemacs is running: =M-x claudemacs-transient-menu=
2. Verify Claude Code CLI is properly configured
3. Run =M-x claudemacs-repl-status= for detailed diagnostic information
4. Check that you're in the correct directory or using the appropriate project file

For debug information, enable debug mode with =M-x claudemacs-repl-toggle-debug-mode=.

** Development

*** Running Tests
#+begin_src bash
make check
#+end_src

This runs the all test suite including linting,
byte compilation,
and documentation checks.

** Releases
This project uses automated releases via [[https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/][semantic-release]]. New versions are automatically published to GitHub Releases and a [[file:CHANGELOG.md][CHANGELOG.md]] is generated based on Conventional Commits. You can find detailed release notes in the CHANGELOG.

*Note*: The `semantic-release` toolchain is used for development/release automation only. The Elisp package itself has no Node.js runtime dependencies and can be installed normally via MELPA.

** Contributing
We welcome various issues and pull requests.
However, please understand that due to leukemia recurrence in June 2024 and ongoing treatment,
response times may be affected.

Ironically,
it was precisely this situation that motivated the development of this package - to continue enjoying programming even under these circumstances.
The desire to maintain productive development workflows during challenging times
drove the creation of claudemacs-repl.

While I have extensively used OSS over the years,
I never imagined I would find myself on the OSS development side under these circumstances.
I have received almost no pull requests for repositories published on GitHub,
please bear with me as responses may take longer than usual while I learn the process.

*Note*: I wanted to automate version updates like semver as much as possible,
so I had Claude Code (consulting with Gemini) automate it,
and it recommended using Node.js mechanisms,
which I have adopted.
I'm not sure if this is the right approach,
but I'll run with it for now.
