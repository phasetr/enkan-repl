;;; simple-3-pane-window-layout.el --- Simple 3-pane window layout for enkan-repl -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2025 phasetr

;; Author: phasetr <phasetr@gmail.com>
;; Keywords: convenience, tools

;; This file is NOT part of GNU Emacs.

;; This file is an example configuration for enkan-repl.
;; It provides a 3-pane window layout optimized for elisp development
;; with Claude Code or other AI assistants.

;;; Commentary:

;; This example provides a 3-pane window layout configuration:
;; - Left-top: Input file buffer (60% width, 55% height, locked)
;; - Left-bottom: Miscellaneous files buffer (60% width, 45% height)
;; - Right: eat terminal buffer (40% width, full height, locked)
;;
;; Features:
;; - Quick switching between input and misc windows (C-t)
;; - eat buffer stays in right pane without switching to it
;; - Send escape/choices to eat from any buffer
;; - Smaller text in eat buffer for better overview
;; - Window protection and buffer history management
;; - Cheat-sheet integration with enkan-repl
;;
;; Usage:
;; 1. Load this file:
;;    (load-file "/path/to/enkan-repl/examples/simple-3-pane-window-layout.el")
;;
;; 2. Initialize layout:
;;    M-x enkan-simple-3pane-setup
;;
;; 3. Use keybindings:
;;    C-t - Switch between input/misc windows
;;    Esc - Send ESC to eat
;;    C-M-1/2/3 - Send choice to eat

;;; Code:
