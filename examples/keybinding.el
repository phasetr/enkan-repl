;; This file provides base keybindings for enkan-repl development.
;; These bindings can be overridden by various window layout modes.

;;; Commentary:

;; Base keybinding configuration for enkan-repl development workflow.
;; All keybinding definitions are centralized in keybinding-constants.el
;; to avoid duplication and ensure consistency.
