;; This file is NOT part of GNU Emacs.

;; This file provides keybinding setup for enkan-repl center file mode.
;; It automatically activates when the center file is opened.

;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides automatic keybinding activation for center file mode:
;; - Detects when the center file is opened
;; - Activates center file specific keybindings
;; - Maintains consistency with other enkan-repl window layout modes
;;
;; Features:
;; - Auto-activation based on center file path
;; - Integration with existing keybinding system
;; - Consistent keybinding overrides following the established pattern
;;
;; Usage:
;; 1. Load this file after setting enkan-repl-center-file:
;;    (setq enkan-repl-center-file "~/center-file.org")
;;    (load-file "center-file-keybinding.el")
;;
;; 2. Open the center file - keybindings will activate automatically

;;; Code:

(require 'enkan-repl)

;; Load keybinding definitions and base keymap
(let ((constants-file (expand-file-name "keybinding-constants.el"
                                         (file-name-directory load-file-name)))
      (keybinding-file (expand-file-name "keybinding.el"
                                          (file-name-directory load-file-name))))
  (when (file-exists-p constants-file)
    (condition-case err
        (load constants-file)
      (error (message "Warning: Failed to load keybinding-constants.el: %s" err))))
