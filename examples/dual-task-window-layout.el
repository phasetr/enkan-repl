;;; dual-task-window-layout.el --- Dual task window layout for enkan-repl -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2025 phasetr

;; Author: phasetr <phasetr@gmail.com>
;; Keywords: convenience, tools

;; This file is NOT part of GNU Emacs.

;; This file is an example configuration for enkan-repl.
;; It provides a dual-task window layout for managing two enkan-repl sessions simultaneously.

;;; Commentary:

;; This example provides a dual-task window layout configuration:
;; - Left: Two input file buffers vertically split (main 65%, sub 35%)
;; - Middle: Main enkan-eat buffer (40% width)
;; - Right: Sub enkan-eat buffer (30% width)
;;
;; Window width ratio: 3:4:3 (input:main-eat:sub-eat)
;;
;; Features:
;; - Quick switching between input files only (C-t)
;; - Automatically selects two enkan-eat sessions
;; - Main task for active work, sub task for background processing
;; - Cheat-sheet integration with enkan-repl
;;
;; Usage:
;; 1. Start at least 2 enkan-repl sessions:
;;    M-x enkan-repl-start-eat (repeat for each session)
;;
;; 2. Load this file:
;;    (load-file "/path/to/enkan-repl/examples/dual-task-window-layout.el")
;;
;; 3. Initialize layout:
;;    M-x enkan-dual-task-setup
;;
;; 4. Use keybindings:
;;    C-t - Switch between input windows

;;; Code:

(require 'enkan-repl)

;; Load keybinding definitions and base keymap
(let ((constants-file (expand-file-name "keybinding-constants.el"
                        (file-name-directory load-file-name)))
